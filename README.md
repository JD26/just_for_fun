# Welcome to `just_for_fun` 🎉

Are you ready to explore the world of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with the power of FEniCSx? This repository is here to share and celebrate numerical experiments, cool tricks, and creative ways to solve PDEs. No pressure, just pure fun with mathematics and coding! 🚀

## What's Inside? 📂
This repository contains:

- Python scripts that use **FEniCSx** to solve various PDEs.
- Examples ranging from simple to advanced, designed to inspire curiosity.
- A playground for learning, experimenting, and pushing boundaries in numerical analysis.

## Why "Just for Fun"? 🤔
Because sometimes, the best way to learn and create is to let go of rigid expectations. Here, you’re free to:
- Test ideas.
- Play with mesh refinement.
- Try unusual boundary conditions.
- Marvel at beautiful plots of solutions.

No judgments, just joy in discovery!

## Getting Started 🛠️

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/just_for_fun.git
   ```
2. **Set up your environment:**
